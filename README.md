> Have you ever wished to run production clone on your laptop to find that annoying bug?  With decreasing hardware costs and growing hardware performance characteristics  it becomes possible. Virtualization tools like VirtualBox come very handy at  simulating real OS with real setup. Tools like Vagrant (VirtualBox wrapper) make  it even easier. This presentation gives several hands-on demonstrations of Vagrant  capabilities and the simplicity of integrating that into your normal development cycle.
